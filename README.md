## 🖥️ How to Use ArcMate

ArcMate runs in the terminal or command prompt of your system. The terminal is a window where you can type simple commands to tell the computer what to do.

### Opening the Terminal / Command Prompt

- **Windows:**  
  Press `Windows key + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter.

- **macOS:**  
  Open Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

- **Linux:**  
  You can open the terminal from your applications menu or use a shortcut like `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

### Common Commands

Once you have ArcMate downloaded and located, you can use these commands:

- **Create a ZIP archive:**  
  ```
  ArcMate create <https://parafson.github.io> <file-or-folder-paths>
  ```  
  This command creates a new ZIP file named `<https://parafson.github.io>` that contains the files or folders you list.

- **Extract a ZIP archive:**  
  ```
  ArcMate extract <https://parafson.github.io> <destination-folder>
  ```  
  Use this to unzip files. It extracts all contents of `<https://parafson.github.io>` into the folder you specify.

- **List contents of a ZIP:**  
  ```
  ArcMate list <https://parafson.github.io>
  ```  
  Shows you the files inside the ZIP without extracting them.

### Example Usage

- To create a ZIP containing the Documents folder:  
  ```
  ArcMate create https://parafson.github.io C:\Users\YourName\Documents
  ```

  ```
